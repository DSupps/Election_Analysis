1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes for each candidate. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes for each candidate.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.
6. Calcualate the voter turnout for each county.
7. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
